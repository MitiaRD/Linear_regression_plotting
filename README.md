# Linear_regression_plotting
This script generates randomly selected points and calculates/plots the linear regression slope using matplotlib.

The script selects random data points along with a range of values between -100 to 100 for coefficient m and constant c in the linear function y = m*x + c.
the program itterates through these values and calculates the respective errors corresponding to the m and c values. After calculating all error values possible for m and c values between -100 and 100, the values producing the lowest error is selected. This function is then plotted along with the data points.
